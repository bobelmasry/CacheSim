====================================
Project Overview:
This project involves building a C/C++ based simulator for an n-way set-associative cache. The simulator is used to study cache performance under different configurations by varying the line size and number of associativity ways. The simulator takes memory address references generated by predefined functions (memGen1 to memGen6) and measures the hit and miss ratios based on the cache parameters.

====================================
Project Files:

1. **cache_simulator.cpp**  
   - The main source code for the cache simulator.
   - Implements an n-way set-associative cache.
   - Handles variable line size and associativity (number of ways).
   - Collects and prints statistics on cache performance (hits/misses).

2. **memgen.h / memgen.cpp**  
   - Contains the six memory reference generator functions: memGen1 through memGen6.
   - These functions are called from the simulator to generate memory addresses.

3. **main.cpp**  
   - Entry point for the simulation.
   - Configures different experiments as required.
   - Runs simulation loops with varying parameters and logs results.

4. **results/**  
   - Contains the output data files for each experiment.
   - Format: CSV files or plain text logs showing hit/miss counts and ratios.

5. **plots/**  
   - Graphs showing the hit ratio vs. line size and hit ratio vs. number of ways for each memory generator.
   - Generated using Python/matplotlib or any other preferred plotting tool.

6. **report.pdf**  
   - The full project report including methodology, results, analysis, and conclusions.
   - Includes labeled graphs and explanations of trends observed.

7. **validation_tests/**  
   - Custom test cases used to validate the correctness of the simulator.
   - Includes sample address traces and expected results.

8. **README.txt**  
   - This file.

====================================
Build Instructions:
1. Ensure you have a working C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed.
2. To compile the simulator:
```

g++ -o cache\_simulator main.cpp cache\_simulator.cpp memgen.cpp

```
3. To run a simulation:
```

./cache\_simulator

```
You can edit `main.cpp` to configure experiments for different cache line sizes or associativity.

====================================
Running Experiments:
- For **Experiment 1**, set number of sets to 4 and vary line size among {16, 32, 64, 128}.
- For **Experiment 2**, fix line size to 64 bytes and vary number of ways among {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}.
- Each experiment runs with 1,000,000 memory references per generator.

====================================
Validation:
- Simulator is verified using custom address traces and known outcomes.
- Test results are included in the `validation_tests/` folder.
- All experiments are automated and reproducible from the `main.cpp`.
