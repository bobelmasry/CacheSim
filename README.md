====================================
Project Overview:
This project involves building a C/C++ based simulator for an n-way set-associative cache. The simulator is used to study cache performance under different configurations by varying the line size and number of associativity ways. The simulator takes memory address references generated by predefined functions (memGen1 to memGen6) and measures the hit and miss ratios based on the cache parameters.

====================================
Project Files:

1. **cache.cpp**  
   - The main source code for the cache simulator.
   - Implements an n-way set-associative cache.
   - Handles variable line size and associativity (number of ways).
   - Collects and prints statistics on cache performance (hits/misses).

2. **results/**  
   - Contains the output data files for each experiment.
   - Format: CSV files or plain text logs showing hit/miss counts and ratios.

3. **report.pdf**  
   - The full project report including methodology, results, analysis, and conclusions.
   - Includes labeled graphs and explanations of trends observed.

4. **README.txt**  
   - This file.

====================================
Build Instructions:
1. Ensure you have a working C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed.
2. To compile the simulator:
```

g++ cache.cpp -o output.exe

```
3. To run a simulation:
```

output.exe

```
You can edit `cache.cpp` to configure experiments for different cache line sizes or associativity.

====================================
Running Experiments:
- For **Experiment 1**, set number of sets to 4 and vary line size among {16, 32, 64, 128}.
- For **Experiment 2**, fix line size to 64 bytes and vary number of ways among {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}.
- Each experiment runs with 1,000,000 memory references per generator.

====================================
Validation:
- Simulator is verified using custom address traces and known outcomes.
- All experiments are automated and reproducible from the `cache.cpp`.
